# Artworking front end development task

There is one small difference between the design and the actual file and that is the (xxx-xxxx-xxxx) on the phone number. I have added them because the phone input is using the pattern attribute and if you don't follow the pattern, you will get a validation error. Without having the x's, the pattern would be unknown that you have to follow. - https://gyazo.com/b05c64eed8d781b819f7f8b6cc96ac90
